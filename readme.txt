### Attribute Swatches and Buttons

One of the key features of this theme is the ability to display product attributes as color swatches or buttons.

1.  **Set Display Type:**
    *   Go to **Products > Attributes**.
    *   When adding a new attribute or editing an existing one, you will see a "Display Type" dropdown.
    *   Choose from "Color Swatch", "Button", or "Dropdown" (default).

2.  **Set Swatch Colors:**
    *   After creating an attribute (e.g., "Metal") with the "Color Swatch" display type, click "Configure terms".
    *   When adding or editing a term (e.g., "Gold", "Silver"), you will see a "Swatch Color" color picker. Select the desired color for that term.

3.  **Set Attribute Order:**
    *   On the **Products > Attributes** page, you can set a "Position" for each attribute. This number controls the order in which they appear in the shop sidebar filters and on the single product page. Lower numbers appear first.

4.  **Display Attribute on Product Card:**
    *   On the **Products > Attributes** page, edit an attribute and you will see a checkbox for "Display in Product Card?". If checked, swatches or buttons for this attribute will appear on the product cards on the shop/archive pages for variable products.

### Product Tabs

The product details section on the single product page is displayed as an accordion.

*   **Global Tabs:**
    *   Go to **Appearance > Customize > Global Product Tabs**.
    *   You can configure up to 3 tabs that will appear on *every* product page. Leave the title and content blank to hide a tab.

*   **Per-Product Tabs:**
    *   When editing a product, find the "Extra Product Tabs Content" meta box below the main editor.
    *   Use a **Heading 2 (H2)** for each tab title. All content below that heading will become the content for that tab. This allows you to create custom tabs for individual products.
